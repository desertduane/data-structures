What did you learn?
I learned how to write a method to delete a node from a binary search tree.
Where did you look?
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search-tree-set-2-delete/

was a site I found with a good example in Java that used comments to explain how it worked 
and helped me understand.
What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
Mostly just looking back at how to recursively move through the tree.
