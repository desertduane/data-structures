Our approach for this assignment was to start by psudo coding it out the best we could. 
We then went and did some research online to find some simple examples of linked-lists 
until we found one that looked like it was what we were wanting to do and used it as a 
helping guide to build out our linked list. Once we had it build was just testing and debugging
to get it to do what we wanted.
