 
We started by taking our Print list method and adapting it to print out our middle list item. We created two counters 
inorder to track our position on our list and compared them to print out the middle list item. Our middle counter only increments
when our counter is an odd number and is greater than 2 which always gives us the middle or the lower middle item in case of an even
numbered list.
