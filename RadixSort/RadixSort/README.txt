What did you learn?
Before starting this challenge I had zero idea what a Radix sort data structure was. 
I learned that it is a sorting algorithm that sorts by looking at each integer that comprises 
a number. This is one of the first data structures where I understand what it is doing but even
after researching and looking at the examples online I still can't see what its doing in the code.

What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
The example in the site above was by far the best example that I could find online to try and 
get an understanding of this sort method that didn't utilise code that I have not learned yet.
