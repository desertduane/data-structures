What did you learn?
Having not known anything about Multi Dimensional arrays before this week I 
did learn that you apparently can rotate them. 

Where did you look?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3488691/how-to-rotate-a-matrix-90-degrees-without-using-any-extra-space

One other site with a similar example Eric found that I forgot to ask him for the link to it 

What notes did you use to help you successfully complete the challenge?
We used online resources to get this challenge working since neither of us had much of a clue 
about multi dimensional arrays let alone how to rotate one.
